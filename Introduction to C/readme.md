# start-with-c

Hi! I'm currently learning C programming, and this repository is where Iâ€™m keeping track of my progress. Iâ€™ll be adding basic examples, exercises, notes, and maybe some small projects as I learn more. If youâ€™re a beginner too, feel free to follow along!

## ðŸ“Œ About

This is my personal journey into the C language. I'm using this repo to:

- Practice what I learn
- Stay organized
- Look back and review later
- Share what might help others starting out


## ðŸ“– Topics I'm Learning

- âœ… Basics of C
- âœ… Data types and variables
- âœ… Control structures (if, loops, switch)
